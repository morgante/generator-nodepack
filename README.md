# Nodepack Generator

Nodepack is a simple generator for Express 4 applications. It installs the necessary dependencies and sets up Express to automatically listen/share routes in a `src/routes` directory.

Two generators are exposed

* `nodepack` - creates a new Express app
* `nodepack:route` - creates a new Express route

## Installation

Install the generator by running: `npm install -g generator-nodepack`.

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
yo nodepack
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
